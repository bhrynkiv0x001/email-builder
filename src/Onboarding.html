            Hi Ricardo,<br /><br />
            We are glad to have you on board with Lab Group, we are inviting you
            to schedule a call with our specially selected references.
            <br /><br />
            Below are a few references who have all worked with us on a project
            very similar to yours. You can choose to talk to three different
            references who had requirements just like yours.
            <br /><br />
            All the best,<br />
            LabGroup
